# smart-mirror-app
A phone app written in Python (with Kivy) that allows control and customization of nearby "smart" mirrors

This project was created long ago, in a time before I had appreciation for things such as proper documentation and version control, so it currently could benefit from a good refactoring.

The app should run just fine on Desktop. After downloading the repo, navigate to the directory and run "python main.py" in the command line.
